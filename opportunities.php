With crypto trading, people can earn by investing, holding (HODLing), or engaging in activities like staking or yield farming.
<br><br> Web3 also includes opportunities in NFTs, decentralized apps (dApps), and blockchain-based projects.<br><br> However, it’s important to approach crypto trading with caution due to its high volatility and risk.
